## Introduction
The Gensokyo Railway is a fictional railway system developed by me(Sapporo Ningyo) and the contributors using Bve Trainsim. It's an imaginary railway system located in Gensokyo of the Touhou Project. The development of this simulated route was based on the real-life railway system in the Shinetsu region of Japan, which is believed by some to be the area where Gensokyo exists.In later versions,elements from railways around the world will also be added.<br>
If you are not familiar with the Touhou Project, you can also enjoy it as a general fictional railway.
Currently, the simulated line operates in one direction(clockwise) from the Hakurei Shrine to the Hakurei Shrine on the Loop Line.In the future,additional lines besides the Loop Line will also be added.
